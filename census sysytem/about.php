This  concentrates on improving the efficiency of census data collection. The usual census data collection system involves an authorized enumerator, who collects the census data manually with paper and pen. This method has been a lot of time consuming and painstaking one. So in todayâ€Ÿs world of data communication a client tool for a portable system becomes important to access and update a database Innovative thinking helps us to improve the existing system .So we thought the finest solution for this handicap would be using a PDA. But such a client tool is yet to be developed. We have designed and developed such a client tool with PDA .Our idea is to implement this by providing a PDA containing the census application to every enumerator authorized by government through which they can collect census data and update the collected data to the census database .
